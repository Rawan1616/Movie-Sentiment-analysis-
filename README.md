# Movie-Sentiment-analysis-
This project is a Movie Review Sentiment Analysis System that predicts whether a given movie review is Positive or Negative.  It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text preprocessing and Machine Learning models for classification. We also built an interactive web-based interface using Gradio for easy user interaction.
